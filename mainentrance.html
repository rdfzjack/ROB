        The main entrance is guarded during business hours by the front security
        guard. Large double oak doors lead into a small vestibule followed by a
        revolving glass door leading to the main banking hall. To the right of
        the entrance is a restricted-access door that leads to the safety
        deposit vault. This is the target.
