        Coutts bank is situated between Post Office Court and Abchurch Lane,
        with the back of the building facing into King William Street.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general area is densely built-up and populated, and there is a fair
        bit of pedestrian traffic.
      </p>
      <p>And you want to rob the bank.</p>
